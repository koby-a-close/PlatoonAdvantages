Investigate batter-pitcher matchups

Using data from fangraphs.com and baseballsavant.com I investigate different statistics and how they can be used to 
create advatages for batters or pitchers.

The original and most widely used example is handedness. Some of the ideas are replicated from "The Book" while others 
use data that was unavailable when "The Book" was written.

The original data used only players with 800 PAs from 1999-2002. I used 800 PAs for batters and 200 IP for pitchers between 2017 and 2019.
